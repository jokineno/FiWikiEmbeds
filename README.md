# FiWikiEmbeds

This work is partly inspired by the SPECTER paper where document level embeddings were trained from scientific articles. Here I am implementing a similar work but use Finnish Wikipedia as a dataset. To build a graph of assosiated articles I'll use internal Wikipedia links in each article.
